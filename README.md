# MouseMaze
# Huong Phan
# Update 3/20/2020

1. In EnvState.py file, any tests are done inside if __name__ == '__main__':
In terminal, please type "python EnvState.py" to run an example of moving the mouse around the maze with functions implemented in Part 1, including goal_test

2. To run the search functions for different files, type in this format: python main.py <file name> <search name>
e.g. python main.py 1prize-open single_dfs
For now, multi-astar is not implemented yet, so it's not available as an option.

3. Until now (3/24/2020), Part 4 multi_astar hasn't run properly yet, so I would try my best to do those as fast as possible and resubmit to you on a later date.
